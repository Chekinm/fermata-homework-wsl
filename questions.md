1. When apply filtration by status to the groups of photots. What should be in count field?
2. As we can have a infinite number of groups, thought we need a pagination
    1. Also could be useful to add particular group endpoint (/groups/<group_id>)
3. I do sort by created_at date. As we don't have any other date

    answer would be:    
    we can and last_updated_at field, and change it when we change status.
    then sort by last updated filed.
